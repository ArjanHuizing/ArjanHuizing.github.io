## Who am I?

I'm a statistician (MSc. Statistics and Methodology) currently working for TNO at the department of Child Health. I also consider myself a social scientist, and I hold a bachelor in Interdisciplinary Social Sciences. Many of my interests in statistics coincide with those in social and medical sciences. These include Bayesian statistics, missing data theory, causal effects and N = 1 models. I am not just interested in the statistical techniques involved, but also in sound implementation for these applied fields. 

I'm also somewhat of a programmer. I started out learning `R` for statistics, and I'm proficient with `R`, `Rmarkdown` and `tidyverse`. I have since branched out to other languages such as `C++` and `Julia`. I'm still a complete beginner at these, but learning these programming languages is something that really excites me. One of my ambitions is to contribute to the development of a package for `R` or `Julia`.

When I'm not behind my computer, I'm usually making music. I'm a big fan of jazz, funk and folk and various electronic genres. I play the button accordion (both the diatonic and chromatic kind). Furthermore, I like to play around on synthesizers now and then. I can probably also muster a few basic chord progressions on a guitar.

I currently live in Apeldoorn with my cat and my boyfriend.
