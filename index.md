## Welcome!

My name is Arjan, nice to meet you. This website is my personal page. In time it may even contain publications and blog posts. Right now it simply serves as an online CV (and an excuse to learn Ruby). If you came to this page to answer a burning question of yours about me, I hope you can find it here. If not, don't be a stranger. Feel free to send me an e-mail.

## Who am I?

I'm a statistician (MSc. Statistics and Methodology) currently working for TNO at the department of Child Health. I also consider myself a social scientist in the broadest sense of the word. I hold a bachelor in Interdisciplinary Social Sciences, and many of my interests in statistics coincide with my interests in social and medical sciences. Those interests include Bayesian statistics, missing data theory, causal effects and N = 1 models.

I'm also somewhat of a programmer. I started out learning `R` for statistics, and I'm proficient with `R`, `Rmarkdown` and `tidyverse`. I have since branched out to other languages such as `C++` and `JavaScript`. I'm still a complete beginner at these, but programming is something that really excites me. One of my ambitions is to develop a package for `R` (one day!).

Other interests of mine include FOSS, making music through various means (both digital and acoustic ones) and playing board and card games (current favourite: Root). I currently live in Apeldoorn with my cat and my boyfriend.
